# Calculation Test Vectors

**Format & process:** vectors are JSON files in `packages/finance-engine/vectors/`, loaded by the test suite. Each vector: `id, formulaId, version, description, inputs, asOf, expected, tolerance, source ('analytical' | 'finance-team' | 'bank-schedule'), reviewedBy`.
**`asOf` field (required):** all vectors carry an explicit `asOf: LocalDate` so the engine never reads the system clock and tests are reproducible on any date. For TV-30x (demo-seed vectors), `asOf` equals the fixed `demoDate` constant declared in `packages/demo-data/src/constants.ts` — finance teammates **must use this same date** in their spreadsheets. Changing `demoDate` is a breaking change requiring a vector version bump and new teammate sign-off.
**Integrity rule:** the engine must never be the source of its own expected values. Expected values come from (a) closed-form analytical results, or (b) independent spreadsheet computation by finance teammates, or (c) real bank schedules (RES-004). Vectors marked `PENDING-FINANCE` below ship as structure with expectations to be filled by teammates before the engine's caveat can be softened.

## Family TV-3xx — Demo seed loan (⭐ the numbers judges will see; source: finance-team)

Seed: P=20,000 JOD, 84 months, start 2024-01-15, r=7.5% (months 1–14) → 9.25% (effective month 15), installment unchanged, 30 months elapsed at demo date, all installments paid on time.
**`asOf` for this family: `packages/demo-data/src/constants.ts → DEMO_DATE`** (a fixed `LocalDate` constant, currently `2026-07-10`). Finance teammates use this exact date in their spreadsheets. Tests call `buildDemoSeed({ demoDate: DEMO_DATE })` before running the engine. Changing `DEMO_DATE` requires re-signing all TV-30x expected values.

| ID     | Assertion                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TV-301 | Outstanding balance at month 30 (estimate) = `PENDING-FINANCE`                                                                              |
| TV-302 | Projected residual at maturity = `PENDING-FINANCE` (must exceed detection threshold — seed was chosen so it does)                           |
| TV-303 | "≈ X JOD less of each installment reduces principal" figure = `PENDING-FINANCE` (old vs new first-period principal share)                   |
| TV-304 | Scenario +50 JOD/month from month 31 ⇒ residual → `PENDING-FINANCE` (seed chosen so residual ≈ 0, months saved > 0) — the demo's money shot |
| TV-305 | Estimated added total cost from repricing = `PENDING-FINANCE`                                                                               |

**Gate:** M3 milestone (engine) is not "done" until TV-30x expectations are filled and passing — this is the hackathon's financial defensibility (Definition of Done link).

## Family TV-4xx — `allocationEstimate.v1` & payments

TV-401 unknown split mid-loan → cost = balance·i, labeled estimated · TV-402 overpayment beyond balance → overpayment state, no negative balance (INV-1) · TV-403 payment before a repricing boundary recomputes across periods (US-005 edge).

## Family TV-5xx — `murabahaProgress.v1` (source: analytical — subtraction only)

TV-501 seed: total 18,600, 22 payments of 310 ⇒ paid 6,820.000, outstanding 11,780.000, progress 36.67% (2dp display) — INV-7 exactness · TV-502 completed financing ⇒ outstanding 0, status `completed`.

## Family TV-6xx — `cardPayoff.v1` (stretch)

TV-601 balance 2,350, APR 24%, min 3% floor 10 ⇒ months + total charges `PENDING-FINANCE`; monotonicity vs fixed-100 path (INV-3) · TV-602 payment 40 < first charge 47 ⇒ `neverPaysOff` · TV-603 APR 0 ⇒ months = ceil(balance/payment), charges 0 (INV-4).

## Family TV-7xx — `aggregates.v1`

TV-701 demo seed set ⇒ total outstanding = loan est. + murabaha official + card official, labeled `includes estimates` (BR-PROV-004) · TV-702 one obligation with no balance ⇒ excluded + named (BR-PROV-005).

## Property-test charter (fast-check, runs alongside vectors)

Generators: principal 100–1,000,000 JOD (3dp), rate 0–30%, term 1–480, up to 5 rate periods, payment sequences with jitter. Properties: INV-1…INV-7 (see calc spec §8). Seeded runs for reproducibility; failures minimized and committed as new fixed vectors (ratchet).
